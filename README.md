> This board is a simple collection of website and tools and tutorials and links and everything I could find around finding a role in tech. I hope it can help people have more success in their job hunts!

> _I don‚Äôt necessarily use all these resources myself, but I wanted to collect as many as I could find - I based it on my personal experience + some links from around the web. But it‚Äôs by all means a fluid document: I really hope you all can [help me expand it](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to be more comprehensive._
